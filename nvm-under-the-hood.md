Earlier this year (January 2021), I got the privilege to do my first public tech talk.
I presented "How **NVM works under the hood**" in the [Colombo JavaScript meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Colombo-JS-Meetup/).
The goal of this presentation is to explain how NVM manages multiple versions of Node.js internally.
